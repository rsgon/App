A simple program with which the user can configure the saving csv file into a database.

Rules of saving are as follows:
The user selects a file and after select the name of the table 
The program parses an xls file and displays a list of all non-empty columns in one column and the duplicate field names in the table in the second column.
User can edit the names of the table fields, but not the file columns.
By clicking on the save button, the program creates a table - if it is not, and stores all data in the database, takes one line and field values using the insert saves them in the database.
Mappings data should be preserved in the json file.
